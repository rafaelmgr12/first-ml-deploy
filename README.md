# About this work

It is my first MLOps project, so the purpose of this repository is educational only. So I used this [tutorial](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/machine-learning-in-production-keras-flask-docker-and-heroku-933b5f885459) to do this Project with some modifications that I believed would be relevant for good practices within this Project.

# Tech :gear:
 The technologies used in this project: 
 * Flask
 * TensorFlow
 * Keras
 * Docker
 * Heroku

# How to run :rocket:
This project used Docker to contenizer the application, and the comands to made is:

**1.** The first thing to do, obviously, is to [download and install Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

**2.** Create the [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) in your main directory

**3.** Create a [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) (without extension) which contains the instructions for building your Docker image

**4.** In a terminal, run the following command to build the Docker image:
  ```bash
 docker build -f Dockerfile -t recog_container:api .
  ```

**5.** Run container in background and print container ID using:
```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 -d recog_container:api
```
Once this is running, you should be able to view your app running in your browser at
```
http://localhost:5000/upload
```

## Deploy :computer:
We can deploy this project [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), the steps are:

**1.** Create a new [Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/) if you donâ€™t have one. Then download Heroku [Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install) which makes it easy to create and manage your Heroku apps directly from the terminal.

**2.** Login to your Heroku account using `# heroku login`

**3.** Log in to Container Registry: `# heroku container:login`

**4.** Create a new Heroku app: `# heroku create <app-name>`

**5.** Build the image based on your Dockefile and push it to this particular app in Heroku `# heroku container:push web --app <app-name>`

**6.** Now release the container with `# docker container:release`

**7.** You can finally open up your Heroku application through the command `# heroku open --app <app-name>`


# Next Steps
* [ ] Construct an end-to-end machine learning application, not using pre-trained model.
* [ ] Solve Heroku bugs that need to fixes.
* [ ] Deploy a ML API and using construct a Web application.
